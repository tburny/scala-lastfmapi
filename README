scala-lastfmapi - A scala library for the last.fm api 2.0
=========================================================

Currently, there isn't really a last.fm library available for Scala (http://scala-lang.org).
The goal of this project is to provide a carefully tested Scala implementation of the full last.fm API 2.0, which is  avaliable at http://last.fm/api/2.0
Of course, this will not only include all API requests available, but various caching and request rate limiting mechanisms.


State of the project
====================
The project is currently under heavy development. The core functionality is already implemented, but surely needs some improvements.
